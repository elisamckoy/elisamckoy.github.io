/******************** Summary *************************
Exercise: Validating a Credit Card

Write methods that use the Luhn Algorithm to validate whether a credit card has a valid credit card number.

Start by running the tests. There are some build errors where the tests are expecting there to be code that doesn't yet exist.
Stub the constructor and CheckCard method out so the test suit may compile and run.

You should also check the length of the parameter of the of the constructor.

Remember constructors are methods with no return (not even void) and have the same name as the class
