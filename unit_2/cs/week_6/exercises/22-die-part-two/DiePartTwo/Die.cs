/******************** Summary *************************
Exercise: Die Part One - Arbitary

Start by copy pasting your solution from Die Part One - this is your starting point

Run the tests to see what is now not working and refactor your code to make the tests pass

Remember to write a reflection at the bottom of the my_solution file.
An important part of practical learning is reflecting on what you have learned.
