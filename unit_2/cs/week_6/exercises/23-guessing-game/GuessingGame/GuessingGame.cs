Exercise: Guessing Game

Time to spread those wings a little. Remember the guess a number game where lots of people think of 7 and so you could get it right - sometimes.
 
Lets make it!

The first task is to stub out:
- the GuessGame constructor
- the Guess method 
- the IsSolved method 

Once you have stubbed these out you will be able to compile the solution and run the tests.

Remember to start with Psuedocoding your intent in the my_solution file.
