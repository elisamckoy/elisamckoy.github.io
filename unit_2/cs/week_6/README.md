#Week 6: Classes

This week you will be working on defining different parts of class: its  constructor, methods and variables/fields/properties. Please make sure to follow each step we ask you to do (write pseudocode, initial solution, refactoring and reflection). This week gets into more advanced concepts, so make sure you pair as often as you need to ensure you are able to learn efficiently and have fun doing it! You'll also want to take some time to research classes upfront before diving in if you are unfamiliar.
