# Welcome to Phase Zero!

Phase-0 is divided into units, and each unit is 3 weeks long. Challenges are due each Sunday before 11.59pm and on Monday, a new weeks worth of work will be released. 

The broad topics we cover in Phase 0 are:



##### Unit 1: [Terminal, Git, Front-End Web Development](./unit_1)
##### Unit 2: [Ruby / C# Fundamentals](./unit_2)
##### Unit 3: [Object Oriented Design, Databases, + Review](./unit_3)
	
### Course Delivery:
Course content is delivered through a combination of Team Treehouse for HTML/CSS, Javascript, Databases, Ruby and Pluralsight for C#. Instructions for signing up / accessing Treehouse and Pluralsight can be found in the [student handbook](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/readme.md)

### To Do: 
* Keep track of how much time you spend on the required sections of Phase 0 challenges. We'll ask you for this information in your weekly submission forms to gauge whether we are giving too much, the right amount, or not enough work each week.
* If you have questions about the instructions or how to do something, are confused, or need help, please post in the appropriate slack channel where staff, coaches and students can respond. 
* If you need to discuss circumstances that may impact on your work, please email your phase-0 facilitator phase0@devacademy.co.nz.
